### Isues: when typing `which python` it points out to the Homebrew python instead of the venv python.
## Fix:

## If there are issues with the python that your venv is using, follow these instructions:

Here's what you can do to resolve this issue and ensure your virtual environment is being used properly:

1. Verify Virtual Environment Activation
First, ensure that you are activating the virtual environment properly:

`source venv/bin/activate`

Once activated, you should see (venv) in your terminal prompt, like this:

`(venv) your-computer:project-directory user$`

2. Check Which Python is Being Used
After activation, check which python is being used:

`which python`

This should point to the Python executable inside the virtual environment, something like:

`/path/to/your/project/venv/bin/python`

If it still points to `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3`, the alias might be overriding the virtual environment.

3. Override the Alias Temporarily
To temporarily bypass the alias, you can directly call the Python interpreter from your virtual environment using the full path:

`/path/to/your/project/venv/bin/python --version`

If that works, you can run Python in the virtual environment using the full path.

4. Remove the Alias for python Permanently
To make sure the python command points to the virtual environment instead of Homebrew's Python, you can remove the alias for python in your shell configuration file (~/.zshrc, ~/.bashrc, or similar, depending on which shell you're using).

Step 1: Open your shell configuration file in a text editor:
```
nano ~/.zshrc  # for zsh
nano ~/.bashrc  # for bash
```
Step 2: Look for a line like:

`alias python='python3'`

Step 3: Either remove or comment out that line (by adding a # at the beginning of the line):

`# alias python='python3'`
Step 4: Save and close the file, then run:

`source ~/.zshrc  # or source ~/.bashrc`

This will remove the alias, so python will no longer point to python3 installed by Homebrew.

5. Create the Virtual Environment with a Specific Python Version
If you continue to have issues, consider recreating your virtual environment with a specific Python version. If python3 is what you want, ensure you create the virtual environment using python3:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install pandas
```

This ensures that your virtual environment is tied to the correct version of Python.

6. Final Check
After performing these steps, check again:

`which python`

It should point to your virtual environment, not the Homebrew installation.
